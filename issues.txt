# List of updates/tests needed (not in order of priority):

1. Add support for HDF5 writing to complete height levels calculation
2. Check/finish implementation of HRRR, MERRA-2, and WRF
3. Finish developing tests for each of the supported models:
    (ERA-I - still support?, ERA-5, MERRA-2, WRF, HRRR)
    check PyAPS for reading grib files
4. Finish developing a test suite for each of the input option sets:
   a. lat/lon/los files             --> tested
   b. lat/lon/statevector files     --> not tested
   c. bounding box/statevector file --> not tested
   d. bounding box                  --> tested
   e. WRF files                     --> not tested
   f. generic weather model files   --> not tested
   g. list of stations w/lat,lons   --> not tested
       -> check netcdf for time series recording

5. Clean up codes and implement function tests
6. Documentation: 
   a. Access and Installation (started)
   b. Test suites (some started)
   c. Examples (some started)

7. Code scaling:
   a. Currently using Dask for processor scaling, only moderately efficient
   b. Implement memory-efficient interpolation for handling large regions
       (e.g., only need a small number of grid nodes around each point)

8. option to display geocoded result
9. CDS API temporary URLs are "suspicious" and blocked by JPL firewalls; currently no work-around
10.dummy-check for bounding box if dem, weather file exists
11. Do we want to be able to support non-regular lat/lon grids? Cubes can handle it but not 2D rasters right now

12. With the build/installation setup, Python puts the imports into site-packages. This means if you make a change to something you may need to re-build the whole package (not hard).
